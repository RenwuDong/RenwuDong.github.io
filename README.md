# About

Running a marathon is hard. Setting up your training plan shouldn't be.

1. Set the date of your race
2. Pick a plan
3. Choose miles or kilometers
4. Download the plan and add it to your calendar

It really is that easy. [Get started now!](https://www.codyhoover.com/calendar-hack)

## Edit a Plan or Create Your Own

Choose the plan you want as a base (or the "New" plans if you want a blank slate) and then click the edit icon next to the title of the plan to begin editing. You can change the title, add and remove workouts, and even reorder them to tailor the workout exactly how you want them.

You can also edit the description of the workouts to change the mileage or add/remove details. If you don't care about switching between miles and kilometers, or you don't plan on sharing the plan with anybody else who might, you can remove/ignore all the "#" symbols and write whatever you want there.

If you do want the plan to work for everone, though, then here's what the "#" symbols are for:

1. Use the "#" symbol before values that should display in the selected units, and the letters "D" and "d" to show "long" or "short" units after the values.

   For example, if you have a plan written in miles, you can write a workout that automatically gets converted to kilometers like this:
    * Workout: : "Warmup #2D, 4x800m, Cooldown #2d"
    * Miles: "Warmup 2 miles, 4x800m, Cooldown 2mi"
    * Kilometers: "Warmup 3 kilometers, 4x800m, Cooldown 3km".


2. The letters "D" and "d" can be omitted or they can be used on their own:
    * "#5 without units, #D without a number" becomes
    * "5 without units, miles without a number"


3. The "totalDistance" column is used to calculate the weekly volume for the plan, so don't forget to fill it out!

## Save your plan for later

Once you've created a plan that you might want to use again in the future, or want to share with someone else, download the plan as a json or csv file so you can import the plan again the next time you need it!
