# Running Training Calendar Hack

This project is inspired functionally and visually by the amazing resource (https://defy.org/hacks/calendarhack/)[https://defy.org/hacks/calendarhack/] and aims to bring new features that I personally wish the site had, and hope others can benefit from as well.

Currently the site is striving for functional parity with the original, but soon will add new features including:

* A simpler and more expressive template syntax which makes it easier to write new plans
* Ability to import and export plans with csv and json
* In-browser editing and creation of plans
